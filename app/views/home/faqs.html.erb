          <h2>What is Payly?</h2>
          <p>Payly allows anyone to set up a simple and easy payment page. These payment pages can be used for almost anything to be able to accept payments from others. Think donations, but without having to use Paypal anymore. </p>

          <h2>Do I need to have a Pin Payments account?</h2>
          <p>Yes, you will need a Pin Payments account. Head over to <%= link_to "Pin Payments'", "http://www.pin.net.au", :target => "_blank" %> and grab an account today. You'll also need to enter in the Live API keys into your settings once you have them.</p>

          <h2>What can I price can I charge?</h2>
          <p>Using traditional pricing, you can price a product for as little as $1, and as much as $1000. We also allow a pay-what-you-want pricing model, which lets your customers pick a price above what you specify (including $0).</p>

          <h2>What currency does Payly charge?</h2>
          <p>All prices are in AUD at the moment.</p>

          <h2>Why can I only have 2 payment pages?</h2>
          <p>Right now we are only offering a limited plan that include 2 payment pages. We will be including unlimited plans soon.</p>

          <h2>How can people pay?</h2>
          <p>Payly supports Mastercard and Visa.</p>

          <h2>What is Payly's cut?</h2>
          <p>Payly currently doesn't take a cut of the transaction amount. It's your money.</p>
          <p>However, all plans are subject to <%= link_to "Pin Payments'", "http://www.pin.net.au", :target => "_blank" %> additional transaction charges of 3% + 30c per transaction.</p>

          <h2>How secure is Payly?</h2>
          <p>Payly doesn't store credit card information. We don't even have credit card information hit our servers. We follow Pin Payments documentation to send credit card information to them before submitting the payment forms.</p>

          <h2>When I view the payment page by click the 'View Page' tab, my page doesn't appear. Why is that?</h2>
          <p>The reason why your payment page isn't showing is because you haven't added your Live Pin Payments API Keys into your settings page.</p>

          <h2>How can I get updates on new features and other news about Space Box?</h2>
